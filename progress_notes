/ Make github repo for my arduino materials
Pull ubunto package to install it
/ Continue reading 1.2 First know arduino
	Identify all pieces of the board
		GND: ground (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/11566/ground-gnd)
			- In electrical circuits: reference point for all signals or a common path in a circuit from which to measure voltages. Aka common drain, as voltage measurement along it is 0
			- As safety feature: earth ground, connection of electrical equipment to ground to prevent user contact with high voltages, like the grounding rods to the ground from household appliances to the floor
		PWM: pulse width modulation (https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/pwm-pulse-width-modulation)
			- Way to digitally encode analog signal levels; can reduce power consumption. Analog signals have continuously varying value, infinite resolution in both time and magnitude. Contrast, digital always take value from finite set of predetermined possibilities. With PWM, duty cycle of square wave is modulated to encode specific analog signal level; PWM signal is digital, at any moment DC supply is fully on or fully off
