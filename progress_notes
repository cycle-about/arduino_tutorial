2.4 Serial Monitor: terminal for Arduino, establishes serial connection to the board
	Accessed from buttin in Arduino IDE: successfully opened it
	Does not have extensive settings that would be needed for advanced serial comms
	Baud rate: speed of data transmission (https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-a-baud-rate.htm)
		Baud = gross bit rate / bits per second
		Bit rate = bits per symbol * symbol rate
		In binary comms, baud rate and bit rate are equal

2.5 Active buzzer
	Electronic buzzers: DC powered, have IC
		Active: has built-in oscillating source, so generates source when electrified
		Passive: no source, so no sound if DC signal used. Needs square waves of frequency 2k-5k to drive it
	unsigned char = 1 byte = 8 bits = 2^8 possible values = 256 possible values (0-255)
	Sketch loaded: makes continuous sound, alternating between the two pitches in the loop
		Pitch looks to depend on delay() having either 1 or 2 and param 



QUESTIONS
	Why does Arduino's pinmode() have INPUT_PULLUP as an option, but not something for a pull-down resistor?
	How does the pitch of the sound in 2.5 Active Buzzer vary, input 12 is not PWM?

2.2 RGB LED
	Overview
		Cathode-Ground-Negative
		Anode-Source-Positive
	Component Introduction
		This type of RGB LED is common cathode: the three LEDs in it share one ground connection
		Each of the three LED color lights has its own anode (positive) connection
	Theory: PWM
		Pulse Width Modulation: way to control power; makes digital wave pattern have effect of analog
		The pulse is still only ever high or low, but power going over it is moderated by how much time it spends high
		eg if output is at 5V for 90% of the time (high width of pulse), load gets 90% of power; so looks brigher than one high 5% of time (low width of pulse)
	Connection schematic: assemble
	Code: load onto uno and run
		Note: could only get the connections to work holding resistors in place by hand. Unexpectedly, it seemed that eg the red one would only show when its resistor was pressed down, odd since the resister would be expected to reduce the power to that color
	Code: read it and the commentary in the pdf
		Put into sublime, this sketch is 82 lines
		Defined constant eg "#define BLUE 3": compiler replaces string BLUE with 3
		pinmode() sets pin to be either input or output
		int is 16-bit (2 byte) value, between -38,768 ie -2^15 and 38,767 ie (2^15)-1

2.3 Digital Inputs
	/ Overview: push different buttons to turn LED on or off
	/ Assemble, load code: works
	/ Look at circuit diagram: trace how it is implemented on the board
		Each switch's right side and the LED have a connection to board's "-" line
		Board's "-" line has one connection to uno's GND
		Left side of each switch connects to a digital input/output on the uno
		A wire goes from the uno, through resistor, then to LED's anode (+) side
	/ Read code more thoroughly: both syntax and how relates to diagram and board
		This sketch is tiny, <20 loc
		Button pinmode() defined as INPUT_PULLUP: activates pullup resistors built onto chip
			https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations/DigitalPins
		Pullup resistor: makes default state of the digital pin HIGH
		There is a pull-down resistor to make default state LOW, but it is not an option for pinmode()

/ Get repo to push, with only my own notes file, no docs
/ Resume tutorials at 1.4 Building IDE for ubuntu
	/ Open arduino IDE: it opens
1.5 Blink and add libraries
	A. Find Blink sketch in IDE: File > Examples > 01.Basics
	Run saved version of it: ERROR
		
		"avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "/dev/ttyACM0": Permission denied
		Problem uploading to board.  See http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#upload for suggestions."

		Move MyBlink from project repo to Arduino program location: same error
		Info from http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#upload
			Error text not on Uploads section (https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/sections/360003198300-Upload)
			Anything on that page that looks releated? yes
			'Error opening serial port' page
				$ ll /dev/ttyACM*
					-> crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Dec 26 11:56 /dev/ttyACM0
				'dialout' is group owner, need to add our user to that group
				$ sudo usermod -aG dialout laura
				$ getent group dialout
					-> dialout:x:20:laura
			But still same error
		After restart of Arduino IDE, same 'can't open device' error
		Try Upload with board disconnected: same error
		After disconnect/reconnect board USB cable: same error
		After restart laptop: works!
	B. Add library from zip: Part 2 Module Learning > Passive Buzzer > patches.zip > OK
		Appears in Sketch > Include Library > 'Contributed libraries' section
	C. Add library from Library Manager: Audio; shows as installed in the manager window
		When selected to include it in sketch, also adds "#include <DAC.h>"
Part 2: Module Learning, 12 sections total
2.1 LED Module: change brightness of LED via different resistance transistors
	Got this working

/ Make github repo for my arduino materials
Pull ubunto package to install it
/ Continue reading 1.2 First know arduino
	Identify all pieces of the board
		GND: ground (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/11566/ground-gnd)
			- In electrical circuits: reference point for all signals or a common path in a circuit from which to measure voltages. Aka common drain, as voltage measurement along it is 0
			- As safety feature: earth ground, connection of electrical equipment to ground to prevent user contact with high voltages, like the grounding rods to the ground from household appliances to the floor
		PWM: pulse width modulation (https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/pwm-pulse-width-modulation)
			- Way to digitally encode analog signal levels; can reduce power consumption. Analog signals have continuously varying value, infinite resolution in both time and magnitude. Contrast, digital always take value from finite set of predetermined possibilities. With PWM, duty cycle of square wave is modulated to encode specific analog signal level; PWM signal is digital, at any moment DC supply is fully on or fully off
